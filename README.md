# UX/UI Web Designer & Front-End Web Developer

I design and develop beautiful websites with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
I took business, programming, art, and design courses during my formal
academic journey. I can combine programming logic skills with design
thinking methods to find and develop innovative business solutions. I
can work with team members by committing to Git or designing together in
Figma. As a designer, I can sketch wireframes and prototype user experience
designs using Adobe XD, Photoshop, Illustrator, and Figma. As a developer,
I code responsive websites in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Over time I
have developed RAMs, a web framework that allows me to quickly assemble
any design with minimal effort and very few lines of code. Also, I am a
photographer, and I take immense pleasure in taking pictures of people
and landscapes.
