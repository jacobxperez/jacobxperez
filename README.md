### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I design and develop beautiful websites with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Along my formal educational journey, I have taken business, programming, art, and design courses. I combine my skills of programming logic with my skills of design thinking to find and develop innovative solutions to business problems.
