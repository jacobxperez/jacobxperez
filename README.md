# Web Designer & Front-End Web Developer

I design and develop beautiful websites with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
I took business, programming, art, and design courses during my formal
academic journey. I can combine programming logic skills with design
thinking methods to find and develop innovative business solutions.
I can work in a team by committing to Git or designing in Figma. I can
sketch wireframes as a designer and prototype user experience using
Adobe XD, Photoshop, Illustrator, or Figma. As a developer, I code
responsive websites in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Over time I have
developed RAMs, a web framework that allows me to quickly assemble
any design with minimal effort and very few lines of code.
