# CSS Architect / Web Developer / Designer 

I design and develop beautiful websites with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have
taken business, programming, art, and design courses along my formal academic
journey. I combine my programming logic skills with design thinking methods to
find and develop innovative business solutions.
