# Web UX Designer & Front-End Web Developer

I design and develop beautiful websites with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
I have taken business, programming, art, and design courses along my
formal academic journey. I combine my programming logic skills with design
thinking methods to find and develop innovative business solutions.
